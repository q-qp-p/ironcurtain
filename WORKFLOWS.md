# Workflows

IronCurtain workflows orchestrate multiple AI agents through a state machine to plan, design, implement, and review code autonomously. Each agent runs in its own Docker container with IronCurtain's policy engine mediating tool access.

**Workflows are designed to be driven from the web UI.** A discovery or design-and-code run produces many artifacts, streams hours of agent output, and pauses at human gates that need review — the CLI is not equipped to surface those interactions comfortably. The CLI commands documented later in this file exist for scripting, automation, and debugging; the web UI is the intended interface for interactive use.

## Quick start (web UI — recommended)

Start the daemon with the web UI enabled and open the printed URL in a browser:

```bash
ironcurtain daemon --web-ui
```

The daemon prints an authenticated URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7400?token=<TOKEN>`). Open it, click **Workflows** in the sidebar, then **New run**:

- Pick a workflow from the dropdown (bundled definitions plus anything in `~/.ironcurtain/workflows/`).
- Enter a task description.
- Optionally set a workspace path (otherwise the workflow runs in a fresh sandbox under `~/.ironcurtain/workflow-runs/<id>/workspace/`).
- Optionally override the model.

Follow the run as it progresses: the state-machine graph (shown above) highlights the current state, the agent-message timeline streams the conversation with markdown rendering, and gate panels appear when human input is needed. Past runs stay listed on the Workflows page once complete. See [Web UI](#web-ui) below for the full feature reference.

## Quick start (CLI — for scripting and debugging)

```bash
# Run the built-in design-and-code workflow on a new project
ironcurtain workflow start design-and-code \
  "Build a TypeScript CLI that converts CSV files to JSON"

# Run it on an existing codebase
ironcurtain workflow start design-and-code \
  "Add rate limiting to the API endpoints" \
  --workspace ~/src/my-api

# Use a cheaper model for experimentation
ironcurtain workflow start design-and-code \
  "Build a palindrome checker" \
  --model anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker running with the `ironcurtain-claude-code:latest` image built
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in environment or `~/.ironcurtain/config.json`
- Global compiled policy (`npm run compile-policy`)

## How workflows work

A workflow is a YAML or JSON file that defines a state machine. Each state is one of:

- **`agent`** -- Runs an AI agent with a role-specific prompt. The agent can read/write files, run commands, and use all available MCP tools. The policy engine controls what's allowed.
- **`human_gate`** -- Pauses execution and asks for your input: approve, request revision, or abort.
- **`deterministic`** -- Runs shell commands (typecheck, lint, test) without an LLM.
- **`terminal`** -- End state (success or aborted).

### Sessions and workspace

Each agent state gets its own Docker session (container). All sessions share the same workspace directory — files written by one agent are visible to the next. The orchestrator passes the previous agent's response text to the next agent so it has context about what was done.

Within a state that runs multiple rounds (e.g., the coder running again after critic rejection), the session is resumed via `claude --continue`. The agent retains its full conversation history from prior rounds, so it knows what it already did and what feedback it received. A new container is created for each round, but the conversation state is persisted on disk and mounted into the new container.

Different states always get separate sessions — the planner, architect, coder, and critic each have their own conversation history and cannot see each other's internal reasoning. They communicate only through the shared workspace and the response text passed by the orchestrator.

### Shared-container mode (`sharedContainer: true`)

Opt in by setting `settings.sharedContainer: true` in the workflow definition. Instead of each agent state spinning up its own Docker container, proxy, and `ToolCallCoordinator`, the orchestrator builds **one** Docker infrastructure bundle at workflow start and every state borrows it. State sessions are constructed with `ownsInfra: false` so `close()` tears down only per-state resources; the bundle is destroyed once when the workflow reaches a terminal state. See [`docs/designs/workflow-container-lifecycle.md`](docs/designs/workflow-container-lifecycle.md) for the full design.

Before each agent state runs, the orchestrator hot-swaps the coordinator's active `PolicyEngine` to match the incoming state's `persona`. The swap is a `POST /__ironcurtain/policy/load` over the workflow's Unix domain control socket; the coordinator reloads `compiled-policy.json` / `tool-annotations.json` / `dynamic-lists.json` from the persona's policy directory under `callMutex` then `policyMutex`, so in-flight tool calls finish against the old engine and new calls use the new engine. The audit log is a single `audit.jsonl` for the whole run; each entry carries a `persona` field so per-state slices can be reconstructed by scanning.

### Workflow run layout

Workflow runs live under `~/.ironcurtain/workflow-runs/<workflowId>/`:

```
~/.ironcurtain/workflow-runs/<workflowId>/
  audit.jsonl                  # single coordinator audit log, persona-tagged entries
  messages.jsonl               # orchestrator message log
  workspace/                   # agent workspace (filesystem MCP root)
  proxy-control.sock           # coordinator control UDS (policy hot-swap endpoint)
  bundle/                      # shared Docker bundle: claude-state/, orientation/, sockets/, escalations/, system-prompt.txt
  states/
    <stateId>.<visitCount>/    # per-invocation session.log and session-metadata.json
```

Nothing lands in `~/.ironcurtain/sessions/` for a workflow run. Single-session CLI (`ironcurtain start`, `mux`, PTY) continues to use `~/.ironcurtain/sessions/<sessionId>/` unchanged.

When a run is started with `--capture-traces`, verbatim token trajectories are written under the run's container bundle:

```
~/.ironcurtain/workflow-runs/<workflowId>/containers/<bundleId>/captures/
  <sessionId>.jsonl            # one file per agent (FSM-state) session
  manifest.jsonl               # session ordering + per-session persona / fsmState / poison status
```

Each FSM-state session gets its own `<sessionId>.jsonl`; the `manifest.jsonl` is the canonical state→session map. Capture is off by default. See [`TRAJECTORIES.md`](TRAJECTORIES.md) for the format and SFT/RL usage.

## The design-and-code workflow

The built-in `design-and-code` workflow follows this flow:

```
plan --> [plan_review] --> design --> [design_review] --> implement --> review
  ^          |               ^            |                  ^          |
  |          |               |            |                  |          |
  +-- revision               +-- revision                   +-- rejected
                                                             |
                                                        [escalate_gate] --> done
```

States in brackets `[...]` are human gates where you review and approve.

**Agents:**

| Role      | What it does                     | Reads                        | Writes                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Planner   | Breaks down the task into steps  | Workspace (if existing code) | `.workflow/plan/plan.md`      |
| Architect | Produces a technical design spec | Plan, workspace              | `.workflow/spec/spec.md`      |
| Coder     | Implements the design            | Plan, spec                   | Code at workspace root        |
| Critic    | Reviews code against the spec    | Spec, code                   | `.workflow/reviews/review.md` |

The coder and critic loop until the critic approves or the round limit is reached (default: 3 rounds). If the limit is reached, you're asked to intervene.

## Workspace layout

```
your-workspace/                  # Workspace root (new or existing repo)
  .workflow/                     # Agent-visible artifacts (gitignored automatically)
    plan/plan.md                 # Planner output
    spec/spec.md                 # Architect output
    reviews/review.md            # Critic output
  src/                           # Code written by the coder
  package.json                   # (or whatever the project needs)
  ...
```

When you provide `--workspace`, the agents work in your existing directory. Workflow artifacts visible to the agents go into `.workflow/` inside the workspace and are automatically added to `.gitignore`. Code changes happen at the workspace root alongside your existing files. Run-level bookkeeping (`messages.jsonl`, `audit.jsonl`, per-state session logs, and — under `sharedContainer: true` — the shared Docker bundle) lives under `~/.ironcurtain/workflow-runs/<workflowId>/`; see "Workflow run layout" above.

When you don't provide `--workspace`, the orchestrator creates a fresh directory.

## CLI commands

### `ironcurtain workflow list`

List available workflow definitions (bundled and user-defined).

```bash
ironcurtain workflow list
```

### `ironcurtain workflow start`

Start a new workflow. The first argument can be a workflow name (looked up from bundled and user directories) or a path to a definition file (YAML or JSON).

```bash
ironcurtain workflow start <name-or-path> "task description" [options]
```

Options:

- `--model <model>` -- Override the model (e.g., `anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5`)
- `--workspace <path>` -- Use an existing directory instead of creating a new one
- `--no-lint` -- Skip the pre-flight lint pass
- `--strict-lint` -- Treat lint warnings as errors

A pre-flight lint pass runs before the workflow starts; error-severity diagnostics abort the start. See [`ironcurtain workflow lint`](#ironcurtain-workflow-lint) for the full check catalog.

Examples:

```bash
ironcurtain workflow start design-and-code "Build a REST API"
ironcurtain workflow start ./my-workflow.yaml "Build a REST API"
ironcurtain workflow start design-and-code "task" --model anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5
```

### `ironcurtain workflow resume`

Resume a failed or interrupted workflow from its last checkpoint.

```bash
ironcurtain workflow resume <baseDir> [options]
```

Options:

- `--state <stateName>` -- Resume from a specific state (synthesizes a checkpoint if none exists)
- `--model <model>` -- Override the model for the resumed run
- `--no-lint` -- Skip the pre-flight lint pass
- `--strict-lint` -- Treat lint warnings as errors

The same pre-flight lint pass as `start` runs before resuming (skipped if the original definition file has been moved or deleted).

### `ironcurtain workflow inspect`

View the status of a workflow without running it.

```bash
ironcurtain workflow inspect <baseDir> [--all]
```

Shows: workflow ID, current state, artifacts, lint diagnostics on the checkpointed definition, and the last 20 message log entries. Use `--all` for the full log.

Lint output is informational only — it never changes the exit code.

### `ironcurtain workflow lint`

Run semantic checks on a workflow definition without executing it. The linter catches cross-cutting issues that structural (Zod) validation doesn't: unreachable states, dangling artifact references, missing personas, and similar smells.

```bash
ironcurtain workflow lint <name-or-path> [--strict]
```

Options:

- `--strict` -- Treat warnings as errors (exit code 2)

Exit codes:

- `0` -- No diagnostics, or warnings only (without `--strict`)
- `1` -- One or more errors
- `2` -- Warnings present and `--strict` was passed

#### Check catalog

| Code    | Severity | Catches                                                                                                 |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WF001` | error    | State cannot reach any terminal — workflow would loop forever if it enters                              |
| `WF002` | warning  | `settings.unversionedArtifacts` entry not produced by any state (silently versioned)                    |
| `WF003` | warning  | Terminal `outputs:` entry not produced by any reachable state                                           |
| `WF004` | error    | Human-gate `present:` entry not produced (human would approve blind)                                    |
| `WF006` | warning  | `settings.maxRounds` set but no transition uses `isRoundLimitReached` guard (limit silently ignored)    |
| `WF007` | warning  | Agent state references a persona not installed locally (runtime failure)                                |
| `WF008` | error    | `maxVisits` state has a cap-guarded transition positioned after a non-approval `when` (cap never fires) |

Example:

```bash
ironcurtain workflow lint design-and-code
ironcurtain workflow lint ./my-workflow.yaml --strict
```

When a workflow is started via the daemon/web UI, error-severity diagnostics abort with a `LINT_FAILED` JSON-RPC error carrying the full diagnostic list so the UI can render it inline.

#### Definition-level validation errors

The following checks are enforced during workflow validation before lint runs, so they are reported as `WorkflowValidationError` issues rather than `WF` lint diagnostics:

- `maxVisits` declared on a non-agent state (only agent states support per-state visit caps)
- State ID does not match `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$` (empty, leading digit, or contains `.`/space/`-`)

### `ironcurtain workflow run-state`

Run a single agent state once against a pre-staged artifact directory. Skips the orchestrator, journal, checkpoint, and transition machinery — one agent invocation, one response written to disk. Intended for prompt iteration, A/B comparing models on identical inputs, and reproducing a state's verdict from a real run without replaying the whole workflow.

```bash
ironcurtain workflow run-state <name-or-path> <state> --artifacts <dir> [options]
```

Options:

- `--artifacts <dir>` -- Required. Directory containing pre-staged artifact subdirs (one per workflow input name)
- `--workspace <dir>` -- Source tree to stage alongside `.workflow/` so the agent can read code
- `--directive <text>` / `--directive-file <path>` -- Inline scoping directive injected as the previous agent's output (synthetic prior state name `debug`)
- `--task <text>` / `--task-file <path>` -- Task description; defaults to `<artifacts>/task/description.md` if present
- `--model <model-id>` -- Override the agent model
- `--mode <builtin|docker>` -- Override `settings.mode`

See `--help` for the full flag list.

#### Staging

The command stages a fresh workspace under `~/.ironcurtain/debug-runs/<workflow>-<state>-<timestamp>/workspace/` (override with `--output`). Each subdirectory of `--artifacts` whose name matches one of the state's declared `inputs` is copied into `workspace/.workflow/<name>/`. Required inputs missing on disk abort with a structured error; optional inputs (`?` suffix) are silently skipped.

When `--workspace` is provided, its contents are copied into the staged workspace first, **excluding any top-level `.workflow/` directory**. Artifact staging always wins on conflict, so pointing `--workspace` at a tree that already contains `.workflow/` will not overwrite the artifacts you staged separately via `--artifacts`.

#### Output

After the agent returns, the command writes:

- `agent-output.md` at the run's output dir -- full agent response (the primary debug artifact; the response can be megabytes and is inconvenient to recover from terminal scrollback)
- Anything the agent wrote to `workspace/.workflow/<output>/` per its declared `outputs`
- A short verdict line on stdout parsed from the response's `agent_status` block
- For Docker-mode runs only: `container-logs.txt` (`docker logs` capture, useful for diagnosing OOM-kills and other container-side failures) and `claude-session-logs/` (a copy of the in-container Claude Code conversation JSONL, useful for verifying what the agent actually saw)

#### Examples

```bash
# Re-run a state against pre-staged artifacts, no source tree
ironcurtain workflow run-state <workflow> <state> --artifacts ~/path/to/.workflow

# Include a workspace so the agent can read code alongside the artifacts
ironcurtain workflow run-state <workflow> <state> \
  --workspace ~/path/to/repo --artifacts ~/path/to/repo/.workflow

# Test routing-driven scoping with an explicit directive
ironcurtain workflow run-state <workflow> <state> \
  --artifacts ~/path/to/.workflow \
  --directive "focus on the issue identified by the prior agent"
```

#### Caveats

This is a single-state runner. It does not transition to other states, does not update the journal, does not write a checkpoint, and does not persist anything back to the source `--artifacts` directory. If a state's behavior depends on the workflow journal or on artifacts produced by other states earlier in the run, those artifacts must be present in the `--artifacts` dir before invocation.

## Human gates

When a workflow reaches a human gate, you're prompted to choose:

- **Approve (`a`)** -- Continue to the next state
- **Force Revision (`f`)** -- Send the workflow back with feedback (you'll be asked to type your feedback)
- **Replan (`r`)** -- Go back to the planning stage
- **Abort (`x`)** -- Stop the workflow

Your feedback text is included in the next agent's prompt.

## Creating custom workflows

A workflow definition is a YAML (preferred) or JSON file. YAML is recommended because prompts can use `|` literal blocks for multi-line strings instead of escaped newlines.

```yaml
name: my-workflow
description: What this workflow does
initial: first_state

settings:
  mode: docker
  dockerAgent: claude-code
  maxRounds: 3
  systemPrompt: Optional persistent context for all agents
  sharedContainer: true # optional; see "Shared-container mode" above

states:
  first_state:
    # ...
  second_state:
    # ...
  done:
    type: terminal
    description: Workflow complete
```

### Agent states

```yaml
my_state:
  type: agent
  persona: role-name
  prompt: |
    You are a ... Your responsibilities: ...
  inputs:
    - plan
    - spec
  outputs:
    - reviews
  transitions:
    - to: next_state
      when:
        verdict: approved
    - to: retry_state
      when:
        verdict: rejected
    - to: escalate
      guard: isRoundLimitReached
```

- **`persona`** -- Either `"global"` (use the default global policy) or the name of an IronCurtain persona created via `ironcurtain persona create <name>`. When set to a real persona name, the agent session uses that persona's compiled policy, memory database, and system prompt augmentation. The orchestrator validates that all non-`"global"` personas exist before starting the workflow.
- **`prompt`** -- Role instructions sent to the agent. The orchestrator automatically appends workflow context (task description, previous agent output, artifact locations) and status block format instructions after your prompt. On re-invocation of the same state (round 2+ via `--continue`), only new information is sent (the role instructions are already in the conversation history).
- **`inputs`** -- Artifact directories the agent should read (under `.workflow/`). Trailing `?` marks optional inputs (e.g., `reviews?`).
- **`outputs`** -- Artifact directories the agent must create (under `.workflow/`). Use `[]` for code-only states where the agent writes to the workspace root.
- **`transitions`** -- Where to go next, using `when` for declarative conditions or `guard` for context-based checks
- **`freshSession`** -- When `false`, re-invocations of this state resume the previous agent session via `--continue`, receiving an abbreviated re-visit prompt. Use this for iterative refinement loops where the agent benefits from retaining its prior reasoning (e.g., a coder receiving critic feedback). Default: `true` (each invocation starts a fresh session, bootstrapping from artifacts on disk).
- **`maxVisits`** -- Optional positive integer. Caps how many times this specific state can be entered. Pairs with the `isStateVisitLimitReached` guard, which fires on the Nth visit's `onDone` (i.e., after the Nth invocation completes). Independent of `settings.maxRounds`. Only valid on `agent` states; placing it on other state types is a validation error. See "Transition actions" for the pairing with `resetVisitCounts`.
- **`skills`** -- Optional list of skill names (strings) selecting which workflow-bundled skills are visible to this state, or the literal string `none` to disable every skill layer. When omitted, the state gets every skill in the workflow package's `skills/` dir (default = all). When set to an array, the state is restricted to the listed names. User-global skills (under `~/.ironcurtain/skills/`) always apply on top, with last-wins on collision. Names that don't exist as `<workflow-pkg>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` fail validation at workflow load. The `skills: none` sentinel is the true off-switch: no workflow-package, user-global, or persona skills are loaded. See "Skills" below.

### Model selection

Workflows can pin a specific LLM at two levels. The `model` field accepts three forms: a `provider:model-name` qualified ID (provider ∈ anthropic, google, openai), a bare model name (treated as Anthropic), or an Ollama-style `name:tag` identifier (e.g. `glm-5.1:cloud`, `qwen3.5-uncensored:35b`) forwarded verbatim to an upstream gateway such as `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`.

Valid IDs depend on which agent is running the workflow:

- **`mode: builtin`** -- any configured provider: `anthropic:claude-opus-4-6`, `openai:gpt-5`, `google:gemini-2.5-pro`, etc.
- **`dockerAgent: claude-code`** -- the adapter passes the bare model name to the `claude --model` CLI flag. By default that targets Anthropic's API. To run a non-Anthropic model (e.g. an Ollama-served `glm-5.1:cloud`, an OpenRouter model, or any other Anthropic-compatible proxy), set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` in the environment to the proxy endpoint; the same model name is then forwarded to that endpoint.
- **`dockerAgent: goose`** -- provider is selected at container startup via the user's `gooseProvider` setting, not via the workflow's `model` field. See the Goose caveat below.

- **Workflow-level** (`settings.model`) -- default for every agent state in the workflow.
- **State-level** (`model` on any agent state) -- overrides the workflow default for that state only.

```yaml
name: mixed-models
settings:
  mode: docker
  dockerAgent: claude-code
  model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6 # default for every agent state

states:
  plan:
    type: agent
    persona: planner
    prompt: 'Plan the work.'
    model: anthropic:claude-opus-4-6 # overrides workflow default for this state
    outputs: [plan]
    transitions:
      - to: implement

  implement:
    type: agent
    persona: coder
    prompt: 'Implement the plan.'
    # no `model` -- inherits settings.model (sonnet)
    inputs: [plan]
    outputs: []
    transitions:
      - to: done

  done:
    type: terminal
```

**Precedence** (highest wins):

1. `--model` CLI flag on `ironcurtain workflow start` / `resume`
2. State-level `model` in the YAML
3. Workflow-level `settings.model` in the YAML
4. `agentModelId` in `~/.ironcurtain/config.json`
5. Hardcoded default (`anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6`)

**Goose caveat.** Per-state switching only takes effect at container spawn for the Goose adapter: Goose reads `GOOSE_MODEL` from its container environment at startup and cannot change models per turn. Claude Code supports per-turn switching via `--model`, so per-state overrides within a single state's multi-round loop work as expected.

### Skills

Workflows can ship purpose-specific guidance to the agent as **skills**: SKILL.md packages — the open standard adopted by Claude Code, Goose, and Codex. IronCurtain stages the resolved set into a per-bundle host directory and bind-mounts it read-only into the container at the path the active agent's native discovery walks (Claude Code: a sibling path picked up via `--add-dir`; Goose: `~/.config/goose/skills/`). The agent then decides when to read each skill based on the frontmatter description.

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) plus any supporting files (helper scripts, fixtures, embedded markdown). Two layers stack at session creation:

- **User-global** -- `~/.ironcurtain/skills/<name>/` -- always applied to every Docker session, regardless of workflow or persona.
- **Workflow-bundled** -- `<workflow-pkg>/skills/<name>/` -- ships alongside `workflow.yaml` inside the workflow's package directory. Per-state filtering with the `skills:` field on agent states selects which workflow-bundled skills are visible to that state; omit the field to expose all of them.

On collision (same `name` in multiple layers), the workflow layer wins over user-global. State filtering excludes the workflow's version of a colliding name, so the user-global one wins by default for that state.

**Workflow package layout.**

```
my-workflow/
├── workflow.yaml         # the manifest
└── skills/               # optional; bundled skills available to this workflow
    ├── analyze/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── synthesize/
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── helper.sh
```

Inside an agent state's YAML:

```yaml
review:
  type: agent
  persona: global
  prompt: ...
  inputs: [plan]
  outputs: [reviews]
  transitions: [{ to: done }]
  skills: [analyze] # only `analyze` from workflow package; user-global always applies
```

In workflow mode the persona-skills layer (`~/.ironcurtain/personas/<name>/skills/`) is intentionally inert — workflow states use the per-state `skills:` field for differentiation, not the persona. Personas still carry skills for standalone (`ironcurtain start --persona <name>`) sessions.

**Three forms of the `skills:` field.** All three only affect Docker-mode sessions (`mode: docker` in `~/.ironcurtain/config.json`). Builtin-mode sessions do not stage skills regardless of this field — skill discovery is skipped entirely on the builtin path. The descriptions below describe Docker-mode behavior.

- `skills:` omitted — default. The state receives every workflow-package skill plus user-global skills (last-wins on name collisions). Persona skills are not loaded in workflow mode (see paragraph above); they apply only to standalone sessions.
- `skills: [name1, name2]` — array. The workflow-package layer is filtered to the listed entries; user-global skills still apply on top.
- `skills: none` — string sentinel. True off-switch: no workflow-package, user-global, or persona skills are loaded for the state. Useful when validating that a specific skill is carrying the work, or when a state should run with no skill context at all.

Note that `skills: []` (empty array) is **not** the off-switch — it filters the workflow-package layer to zero, but user-global skills still load. Use `skills: none` for the strict off-switch.

### Human gate states

```yaml
my_gate:
  type: human_gate
  description: Human review
  acceptedEvents:
    - APPROVE
    - FORCE_REVISION
    - ABORT
  present:
    - plan
  transitions:
    - to: next
      event: APPROVE
    - to: revise
      event: FORCE_REVISION
    - to: aborted
      event: ABORT
```

- **`acceptedEvents`** -- Which options to show the user. Choose from: `APPROVE`, `FORCE_REVISION`, `REPLAN`, `ABORT`.
- **`present`** -- Artifact names to show the user for review

### Deterministic states

```yaml
validate:
  type: deterministic
  description: Run tests and lint
  run:
    - - npm
      - test
    - - npm
      - run
      - lint
  transitions:
    - to: next
      guard: isPassed
    - to: fix
```

Commands are arrays of argument arrays (no shell strings). Use `isPassed` guard for success transitions.

When a deterministic state fails (any command exited non-zero) and routes to an agent state, the failed commands' captured output (stderr per command, falling back to stdout when stderr is empty, joined across all failing commands) is forwarded as the agent's prior-state context, rendered under `## Output from <det-state> / Directive: ...` in the agent's prompt. Successful deterministic results update only `previousTestCount`; the agent's own prior-state context fields (`previousAgentOutput`, `previousAgentNotes`, `previousStateName`) are left untouched, so the next agent still sees the last agent state's output.

### Terminal states

```yaml
done:
  type: terminal
  description: Workflow complete
  outputs:
    - reviews
```

Optional `outputs` lists artifacts to include in the final summary.

### Transition conditions

There are two ways to control transitions: declarative `when` conditions and code-based `guard` functions. `when` clauses with free-form verdict strings are the primary routing mechanism for agent states. Guards are reserved for conditions that require workflow context.

**`when` -- declarative conditions (preferred):**

```yaml
- to: done
  when: { verdict: approved }
- to: fix
  when: { verdict: rejected }
- to: validate
  when: { verdict: thesis_validate }
- to: escalate
  when: { verdict: escalate }
```

`when` matches against the agent's status block output. All specified fields must match (AND semantics). The primary matchable field is `verdict`. Other fields (`completed`, `confidence`, `escalation`, `testCount`, `notes`) are also available but are deprecated for routing -- use `verdict` and `notes` instead.

The `verdict` field accepts any string value, enabling custom verdicts for direct routing (e.g., `"thesis_validate"`, `"escalate"`, `"reanalyze"`). Well-known values are `approved`, `rejected`, `blocked`, and `spec_flaw`. This is the recommended pattern for new workflows: instruct the agent to use specific verdict strings in its prompt, then match on them with `when`.

`when` is only available on agent state transitions (not deterministic states). A transition cannot have both `when` and `guard`.

**`guard` -- code-based conditions (for context-based checks):**

| Guard                      | Checks                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isRoundLimitReached`      | Max visit count across all states >= `settings.maxRounds` (workflow-wide cap)                                                            |
| `isStateVisitLimitReached` | Fires on the Nth `onDone` when the state carries `maxVisits: N` (see [`maxVisits`](#agent-states)). Inert on states without `maxVisits`. |
| `isStalled`                | Agent produced identical output artifacts as previous round                                                                              |
| `isPassed`                 | Deterministic state commands all passed                                                                                                  |

Use `guard` for conditions that depend on workflow context (round limits, stall detection) or for deterministic state transitions (`isPassed`). For verdict-based routing, use `when` clauses -- e.g., `when: { verdict: "approved" }` supports any verdict string for direct routing.

`isRoundLimitReached` applies a single workflow-wide cap across every state; `isStateVisitLimitReached` scopes the cap to one state via that state's `maxVisits`. Use the per-state guard for narrowly bounded loops (e.g., a review step that should escalate after N iterations without halting the whole workflow).

### Transition actions

A transition may declare an ordered list of side-effects via `actions:`, in addition to the default context update performed on every transition. This is valid on agent, deterministic, and human gate transitions alike. Each entry is an object discriminated on `type`:

```yaml
transitions:
  - to: next_state
    when: { verdict: approved }
    actions:
      - type: resetVisitCounts
        stateIds: [review_state, build_state]
```

| Action type        | Params                    | Effect                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resetVisitCounts` | `stateIds: [string, ...]` | Zeroes the visit counter for each listed state. All listed IDs must reference existing states. |

Actions run in the order listed. The default action always runs first: the context-update action for agent/deterministic transitions, or `storeHumanPrompt` + `clearError` for human gate transitions.

**Human gate reset pattern.** When a bounded loop escalates to a human gate on cap-reached, the gate's APPROVE transition typically routes back into the loop. Without a reset action, the visit counter is still at the cap and the next `isStateVisitLimitReached` check fires immediately, re-escalating to the gate. Declare `resetVisitCounts` on the APPROVE transition so the human's approval actually restarts the loop:

```yaml
escalate_gate:
  type: human_gate
  acceptedEvents: [APPROVE, ABORT]
  transitions:
    - to: build_state
      event: APPROVE
      actions:
        - type: resetVisitCounts
          stateIds: [review_state, build_state]
    - to: aborted
      event: ABORT
```

**Bounded-loop pattern.** `maxVisits` + `isStateVisitLimitReached` + `resetVisitCounts` compose to bound a review/rework loop and reset the cap when the loop is re-entered from outside:

```yaml
states:
  plan:
    type: agent
    persona: planner
    description: Produce a plan
    prompt: 'Plan the task. Emit verdict: ready.'
    inputs: []
    outputs: [plan]
    transitions:
      - to: review
        when: { verdict: ready }
        # Fresh entry into the review loop -- clear any prior cap.
        actions:
          - type: resetVisitCounts
            stateIds: [review]

  review:
    type: agent
    persona: reviewer
    description: Review the plan; loop until approved or cap reached
    prompt: 'Review the plan. Emit verdict: approved or rejected.'
    inputs: [plan]
    outputs: [reviews]
    maxVisits: 3
    transitions:
      - to: done
        when: { verdict: approved }
      # Ordered before the rejection transition so the cap wins on visit 3.
      - to: escalate_gate
        guard: isStateVisitLimitReached
      - to: plan
        when: { verdict: rejected }

  escalate_gate:
    type: human_gate
    description: Review loop exhausted
    acceptedEvents: [APPROVE, ABORT]
    transitions:
      - to: done
        event: APPROVE
      - to: aborted
        event: ABORT

  done:
    type: terminal
    description: Done
  aborted:
    type: terminal
    description: Aborted
```

On the third `review` visit the cap fires before the rejection `when` clause is evaluated, routing to `escalate_gate`. Re-entering `review` via `plan` clears the counter so the loop starts fresh.

### Stall detection

The `isStalled` guard compares SHA-256 hashes of a state's output artifact files between consecutive visits. If an agent produces byte-identical output on two consecutive invocations of the same state, the guard returns true — the agent is stuck in a loop producing the same result.

This is useful for coder-critic loops where the coder might repeat the same implementation after being rejected:

```yaml
review:
  type: agent
  description: Reviews code against the spec
  transitions:
    - to: done
      when:
        verdict: approved
    - to: escalate_gate
      guard: isStalled
    - to: implement
      when:
        verdict: rejected
```

The `isStalled` transition should be ordered before the rejection transition so it fires first when the output is identical. This routes to a human gate or alternative state instead of letting the loop continue indefinitely.

## Agent status block

Every agent must end its response with a YAML status block. The orchestrator automatically appends format instructions to the agent's prompt, so you only need to describe what verdicts to use in your prompt template. The minimal required fields are:

```yaml
agent_status:
  verdict: approved
  notes: 'Brief summary of what was done'
```

- **`verdict`** -- Free-form string that drives transition routing. Well-known values are `approved`, `rejected`, `blocked`, and `spec_flaw`, but workflows may define custom verdict strings for direct routing (e.g., `thesis_validate`, `escalate`).
- **`notes`** -- Brief summary passed to the next agent as context.

The following fields are parsed if present but are deprecated and should not be relied upon for routing:

- `completed` -- Defaults to `true`. Use `verdict` instead.
- `confidence` -- Defaults to `"high"`. Validated against `high`/`medium`/`low` but not used for routing.
- `escalation` -- Defaults to `null`. Use `notes` for inter-agent context.
- `test_count` -- Defaults to `null`. No longer consumed by any guard.

The `prompt` field in your workflow definition should include instructions about what the agent does, but the orchestrator automatically appends status block format instructions. If the agent forgets the status block, the orchestrator retries once.

## Message log

Every workflow produces a `messages.jsonl` file at `~/.ironcurtain/workflow-runs/<workflowId>/messages.jsonl` containing all agent exchanges. Use `ironcurtain workflow inspect` to view it, or read it directly for debugging.

## Checkpointing and resume

The orchestrator saves a checkpoint after every state transition. If a workflow fails (agent error, Docker issue, Ctrl+C), you can resume from the last checkpoint:

```bash
ironcurtain workflow resume /path/to/base-dir
```

For workflows that ran before checkpointing was added, synthesize a checkpoint at a specific state:

```bash
ironcurtain workflow resume /path/to/base-dir --state review
```

Artifacts and conversation state survive across resume. Docker sessions use `claude --continue` to preserve conversation history within each role.

## Web UI

The intended interface for interactive workflow runs (see [Quick start (web UI)](#quick-start-web-ui--recommended) above for the basic launch). This section is the feature reference for what the Workflows page exposes once the daemon is running.

### Starting and resuming workflows

The Workflows page provides a form to start new workflows. Select a definition from the dropdown (bundled and user-defined workflows are auto-discovered), enter a task description, and optionally specify a workspace path. The web UI also lists resumable workflows -- previously checkpointed runs that can be continued with one click. You can import a workflow from an external directory by providing its base directory path.

### State machine visualization

When you select a running workflow, a state machine graph shows all states and transitions from the workflow definition. The current state is highlighted, and completed states are visually distinguished. The transition history table shows timestamps and durations for each state change.

### Gate review

When a workflow pauses at a human gate, the web UI shows a review panel with the gate's accepted actions (Approve, Force Revision, Replan, Abort). The panel includes:

- **Artifact browser** -- rendered markdown content from the `.workflow/` artifact directories (plan, spec, reviews) presented as tabs for quick comparison.
- **Feedback input** -- when choosing Force Revision, a text area lets you provide feedback that gets included in the next agent's prompt.

The Workflows page auto-selects a workflow when a gate is raised, so you are taken directly to the review panel when action is needed.

### Workspace browser

A collapsible file browser shows the workspace directory tree during and after workflow execution. You can navigate directories and view file contents with syntax highlighting. Binary files and files over 1MB are excluded. The `.git` and `node_modules` directories are filtered from listings.

### Persona viewer

The web UI includes a read-only Personas page (accessible from the sidebar) where you can view all configured personas, their constitutions (rendered as markdown), and compiled policy summaries. Personas are created and managed via the CLI (`ironcurtain persona create|compile|edit|delete`); the web UI provides a convenient way to review them.

### Development and testing

For frontend development without Docker or an API key, use the mock WebSocket server:

```bash
cd packages/web-ui && npm run mock-server   # Terminal 1
cd packages/web-ui && npm run dev            # Terminal 2
```

Open `http://localhost:5173?token=mock-dev-token`. The mock server simulates workflow lifecycle events with realistic timing. See [docs/e2e-workflow-testing.md](docs/e2e-workflow-testing.md) for the full E2E testing guide.

## User-defined workflows

Custom workflow definitions (`.yaml`, `.yml`, or `.json`) can be placed in `~/.ironcurtain/workflows/`. Files in this directory are discovered by both `ironcurtain workflow list` and the web UI's definition dropdown. User-defined workflows override bundled ones if they share the same name. When both YAML and JSON versions exist with the same name, YAML takes precedence.
